# Blackjack
Blackjack is a gambling game where you, the player, goes up against a dealer, who represents the house (casino). You and the dealer are each dealt two cards from a standard 52-card deck. Each card represents a value (1-11). Upon recieving your two cards, you have two goals in mind: 

- make your cards add up to a number near or exactly 21, without going over 21
- To "beat the dealer" meaning your cards are closer to 21 than his, or have the dealer "bust", which means his cards add up to over 21

After recieving your cards, you can either "hit", which means you add another card to your deck, or you "stand" meaning you keep the number of cards you have at that point and hope you win! You can also "Double down", which will be explained later. If you ever "hit" and have your cards add up to over 21, you "bust", which means you lose that hand.
